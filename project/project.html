  <h3>Explainable AI for Predictive Analytics on Employee
    Attrition</h3>
    <p>Leaving of employees is one of the most threatening points of concern for IT companies today. 
        Whenever a company hires an employee, or a group of employees, it spends a lot of its time and resources on the purpose of training them. 
        Hiring employees every year is itself a big challenge, while retaining them being the other one. In the field of IT, Employees face many challenges in the company too,
         which leads them to leave the company and join another one. In many ways, an employee leaving a company affects its infrastructure.
        In our Project we analyzed the possible factor behind employee leaving
the company.
We focused on in depth analysis of feature using LIME and
SHAP in order to explain the feature and their importance
level in details.

    <h3>Online doctor appointment system (WEB APPLICATION)</h3>
      <p>During covid-19 people were very afraid to visit doctor’s clinic
        and get an appointment, that is the idea behind the project.
        Patient can create their account and book an appointment
        easily

    <h3>Heart Attack Prediction using Machine Learning</h3>
      <p>To predict heart attack I uses a heart disease dataset from
        kaggle and train four different Machine Learning model and chosen a
        model which gives best accuracy. I also deploy that model
        To predict a person having heart attack or not.

    <h3>IMBALANCED HEALTHCARE DATA HANDLING</h3>
      <p>A considerable amount of health record data has been stored due to recent advances in the digitalization of medical systems. 
        However, it is not always easy to analyze Health record data, as medical datasets are not well balanced in their class sets. In healthcare datasets to identify rare diseases in medical diagnostics etc.
         usually high-risk patients are tended to be in the minority class. For such reason traditional classification methods become biased towards majority class as they consider the minority class as noise. Thus, the model become useless.
          To build a good Machine Learning model a well-balanced dataset is very Important. Using the imblearn library from python we’ll try over-sampling and under-sampling to balance the class in the healthcare dataset. 
          And try to develop a better model which will give us a better accuracy than traditional models without considering the relative distribution of each class in the dataset.

    <h3>Stock Market Prediction using LSTM</h3>
      <p>It is never easy to invest in the stock market.
         When, which stock price is going to rise and fall, is very uncertain. 
         Possibly nothing exists for a human being to predict the trend of the stock market.
          The abnormality of the stock market doesn’t even allow simple machine learning algorithms to predict the future stock prices with high accuracy. 
          Neural networks are extremely complex and tend to give a higher accuracy when it comes to complex data. 
          The conventional neural network doesn’t have the ability to store what it previously learned or trained on. LSTM’s there to help.
          We used LSTM to fit a function that can predict the stock value of future 15days.
